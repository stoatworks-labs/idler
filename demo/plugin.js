/**
 * Idler — the browser demo.
 *
 * The Windows 95/98 screensaver suite, as two FFGL plugins: a source (`Idler`)
 * and an effect that composites over the clip (`Idler Mask`). This page runs the
 * plugin's own two shader programs on real pixels, driven by a JavaScript port
 * of the plugin's 3D engine and its savers.
 *
 * ## What is the plugin's, and what is not
 *
 * Idler is the odd one out in this fleet, and it is worth being exact about it
 * because the honesty question has a different answer here than on the other
 * demos.
 *
 * On tinsel, orrery, downpour and the rest, the plugin *is* a fragment shader:
 * copying the shader across means the demo runs the plugin's actual work. Idler
 * is not shaped like that. `source/Shaders.cpp` is 242 lines and two programs,
 * and almost nothing lives there — the scene shader lights and fogs a triangle
 * soup, and the composite shader blends the result over the clip. Everything
 * that makes Idler *Idler* is CPU-side: a small 3D engine and eleven savers that
 * build meshes into a `Scene`.
 *
 * So on this page:
 *
 * - **The two shader programs are the plugin's, copied character for character**
 *   from `source/Shaders.cpp`. `demo/tools/check_shaders.py` proves that, and it
 *   runs in `tools/verify.sh`.
 * - **Everything else is a hand port**, and a hand port is a second
 *   implementation. `Vec.h`, `Scene.h`, `Mesh.cpp`, `Hash.h`, `Controls.cpp` and
 *   the savers were translated by hand into the JavaScript below. Nothing checks
 *   that translation — there is no equivalent of `idtest --replay` or
 *   `--geometry` here. Where the C++ harness is the reason to believe the maths,
 *   this page is not. That is said on the page too, in `differences`.
 *
 * ## The one thing most likely to be subtly wrong
 *
 * Nine of the eleven savers are pure arithmetic on time. **3D Pipes and 3D Maze
 * grow**: where a pipe goes next depends on where it has been. They are made
 * pure by *deterministic replay* — the state at time `t` is by definition the
 * state reached by replaying from the seed to tick `floor(t * tickRate)`. The
 * cache is an optimisation that must never change the answer, so a changed seed,
 * a changed growth parameter, or a time earlier than the cache rebuilds from
 * tick zero.
 *
 * `Random` below is counter-based rather than a state machine for exactly this
 * reason: draw `n` is `Hash2(n, seed)` and depends on nothing before it, so a
 * replay resumed from a checkpoint draws the same numbers a replay from zero
 * would have. Get that wrong and the picture is still plausible — it is simply a
 * different maze.
 *
 * A browser tab that loses focus throttles, so a scrubbed or backgrounded page
 * can ask for a large forward jump; `kMaxReplaySteps` bounds it, as it does in
 * the plugin.

 * weight. Density = copies in flight. Length = how far it bounces vertically.
 * Complexity = how fast it bounces. Variation = how much the copies differ in

 * a broken one.
 *
 * The scroll position is `time * speed` reduced modulo one repeat length, so it
 * is a pure function of time and never accumulates. The repeat length is the
 * text's own width plus a gap, which means A LONGER MESSAGE SCROLLS WITH THE

/**
 * 3D Text.
 *
 * Lettering with real depth, turning on the spot.
 *
 * Size = cap height. Line Width = stroke weight, and it is the control that most
 * changes the character of the thing: thin reads as neon, heavy as a chrome logo.
 * Length = extrusion depth. Complexity = how the text tumbles, from a plain spin
 * about the vertical to a full three-axis roll. Density = copies stacked in
 * depth. Variation = hue spread across the copies.
 *
 * HOW A STROKE BECOMES A SOLID. The font is strokes down the middle of each
 * letter rather than outlines, so a stroke is turned into a slab: the polyline is
 * offset either side by half the weight — with the same mitred joins the 2D line
 * builder uses — and that ribbon is given a front face, a back face and walls all
 * the way round. The result has silhouette, catches the light on its sides as it
 * turns, and there is nothing to see through. What it is NOT is a typeface
 * extruded: the letters have a constant stroke weight, like signage.
 *
 * THE MITRE LIMIT MATTERS MORE HERE THAN IN 2D. An unlimited mitre on a sharp
 * corner — the apex of an A, the point of a V — sends the offset point off to
 * infinity. In 2D that draws a spike; here it drags a SOLID spike across the
 * frame, and because it is real geometry with real depth it also fights the depth
 * buffer of everything behind it. Load bearing rather than cosmetic.

/**
 * 3D Pipes.
 *
 * Plumbing growing into a box, one elbow at a time, until it fills up and starts
 * again.
 *
 * WHY THIS ONE NEEDS REPLAY. Where a pipe goes next depends on where it has
 * already been — it must not run back through itself — so the state at segment
 * 400 is not computable from the clock without segments 1 to 399. It is made pure
 * by GrowingSaver: the state at time t is DEFINED as the state reached by
 * replaying from the seed to tick floor(t * tickRate).
 *
 * A tick is ONE CELL OF TRAVEL. That is the natural unit: the smallest thing that
 * can happen, and what the alpha inside a tick interpolates — the growing tip of
 * the pipe, the only part of the picture that moves smoothly.
 *
 * Density = pipes growing at once (1..5). Complexity = the grid, 6..18 cells a
 * side. Size = pipe radius. Length = how full the box gets before it clears.
 * Variation = how often a pipe turns.
 *
 * Every so often a joint comes out as a TEAPOT instead of a ball. That was in the
 * original and it is the detail people remember, so it is here — chosen by hash
 * off the pipe and the joint index rather than by a counter, which is what keeps
 * it in the same place on a replay.
 *
 * CLEARING IS A STEP, NOT A SPECIAL CASE. When the box is full the state resets
 * inside step(), so growth carries on for as long as the clock does and the
 * replay stays a plain loop. Nothing outside this class knows a reset happened.

/**
 * 3D Maze.
 *
 * A first-person walk down brick corridors, taking whatever turning comes up,
 * forever — and the maze is genuinely endless: it is built in chunks around the
 * camera as it goes, and the ones it has left behind are dropped. There is no
 * edge to reach and no far corner to have seen.
 *
 * WHY IT HAD TO BE ENDLESS. It used to be one square grid, six to sixteen cells
 * a side, generated once and walked for the rest of the clip — a hundred cells,
 * which is about a minute, and then every corridor is one the camera has already
 * been down. Worse, a perfect maze is a TREE: between any two cells there is
 * exactly one route, so every dead end costs a full retrace back up the corridor
 * you came down, and one tick in fifteen was a 180-degree turn on the spot. Net
 * displacement after a minute of walking was under three cells. It was pacing.
 *
 * HOW IT IS ENDLESS. Space is divided into chunks of `chunk` × `chunk` cells,
 * and a chunk's walls are a pure function of its chunk coordinates and the seed,
 * so building one twice gives the same maze. Two things join them up: DOORWAYS,
 * two per shared edge, at positions drawn from a stream keyed on the edge itself
 * so both sides agree without consulting each other; and BRAIDING, which goes
 * back over the dead ends and opens one more wall on all but one in six of them.
 * That is what turns the tree into a graph with loops in it — with somewhere
 * else to go the walk is not forced back down its own approach, and the
 * 180-degree turn drops from one tick in fifteen to about one in a hundred and
 * fifty. The ones left in are worth keeping: walking up to a wall is part of
 * what this saver is, and with loops around it a dead end costs one cell rather
 * than a retrace of twenty.
 *
 * Only the chunks near the camera are kept. The pass counts go with them, so a
 * chunk revisited after a long absence is unexplored again — deliberate, and
 * deterministic, because what gets dropped depends only on where the walk has
 * been.
 *
 * WHY THIS ONE NEEDS REPLAY. Which corridor the camera is in depends on every
 * junction it has already taken. Like Pipes, it is made a pure function of time
 * by GrowingSaver. Generating a chunk draws from ITS OWN stream, never from the
 * walk's, so the walk replays the same whatever the drawing happened to build.
 *
 * A tick is one cell of travel, and the alpha inside it slides the camera from
 * one cell to the next — and swings the heading round a corner. That turn is the
 * only thing here that is not a straight line, and it is EASED rather than
 * linear, because a linear heading interpolation whips round the corner at a
 * constant rate and reads as a camera on rails rather than as walking.
 *
 * Complexity = the chunk, 6..16 cells a side — the scale of the maze's structure
 * rather than its size, since it has no size. Density = how often the walk
 * prefers a turn. Size = corridor width against wall height. Fog = how far you
 * can see, and it is the control that matters most: a corridor ending in a
 * hard-edged wall at the far clip reads as a bug, and the original faded to black
 * too. It also sets how far the maze is built, since there is no point building
 * what the fog hides. Variation = wall colour spread, which stands in for the
 * brick texture.
 *
 * THE BRICKS ARE GEOMETRY, NOT A TEXTURE. A maze walk spends a lot of its time
 * facing a wall — you travel up to a junction and the thing in front of you is a
 * wall half a cell away. With a flat-shaded wall that frame becomes a single
 * rectangle of one colour, and it reads as the renderer having failed rather than
 * as a wall. With courses of brick on it, the same frame reads as a wall you have
 * walked up to. The geometry was right the whole time; the picture was not.

    'The two shader programs are the plugin\'s own text, copied across and checked character for character. Everything else — the 3D engine, the eleven savers, the parameter conversions — is a HAND PORT, and a hand port is a second implementation of the thing this plugin actually does.',
    'That port is checked, but only so far. Every saver\'s mesh is built offline and compared against the plugin\'s own `idtest --geometry`: same triangle count, same vertex count, same bounding box, all eleven. That catches a mis-ported loop bound or a conversion curve that has drifted — the errors that look fine on screen. It does not compare individual vertices, colours or normals, and there is no equivalent here of `idtest --replay`, which is what proves the two growing savers rebuild identically after a scrub. A bounding box is a coarse instrument.',
    'Sync offers Free, Beat, Bar and Manual because the plugin declares all four, but a browser has no host tempo and no transport. Beat and Bar therefore run on the plugin\'s own fallback of 120 BPM with the bar position taken from the same clock, which makes them deterministic functions of time rather than locked to anything.',
    'The Audio parameter itself is not here. In Resolume it is an FFT buffer the host fills from an audio source picker, and a page has no host analysis — so the audio level is always zero, which is the plugin\'s own behaviour with nothing routed: Audio Size and Audio Speed do nothing rather than the picture twitching to a phantom signal.',
    'The display-only About parameter is not shown; it carries the plugin\'s version and licence text, which the header links cover here.',
    'Picking a preset here resets every parameter the preset does not name back to its default, where the plugin leaves Sync, Phase, Seed, the text, Mask Mode, Mix and the audio controls exactly as the operator left them.',
    'The plugin allocates its own framebuffer with a depth buffer, because a host framebuffer is colour-only and six of the savers need a depth test. This page does the same, but a browser gives no promise about the depth precision it hands back, so coplanar surfaces may z-fight here where they do not there.',
